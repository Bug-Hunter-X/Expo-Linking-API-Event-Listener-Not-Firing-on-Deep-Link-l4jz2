This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not trigger if the app is launched from a deep link that doesn't include a URL scheme that is registered in your app's configuration.  Another cause can be that the initial URL isn't properly handled due to a race condition between the app's startup and the `Linking` API's event listener.
